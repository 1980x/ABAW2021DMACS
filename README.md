<strong>CCT: Consensual Collaborative Training and Knowledge Distillation based Facial Expression
Recognition under Noisy Annotations</strong>


<strong> Our proposed CCT framework<strong>
  
![Proposed framework](images/ECCT_framework.png)

CCT involves co-training of three networks θ1, θ2 and θ3 jointly using a convex combination of supervision loss and consistency loss. Consensus is built by
aligning the posterior distributions (shown as dotted red curves between p1, p2 and p3 ) using consistency loss. Dynamic weighing factor(λ) that balances both the losses is given by Gaussian like ramp-up function.
